Description: Rcpp implementation of the "Random Intersection Trees with discretization" classification algorithm. The package exports
  two functions: one which searches for informative interactions using the aforementioned algorithm, another that applies 
  a basic argmax classification rule on the interactions returned by the first function in order to classify new instances.
